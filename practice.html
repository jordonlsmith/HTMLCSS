        <blockquote><p>Hello.  I would like to start by telling you the purpose of my writing so that you will know more about my process.</p><p class="important">I like to talk a lot about sports.  I think that sports can really tell us a lot about life.  I am an <span class="emphatic">avid golfer</span> and former <b>all-state</b><br> basketball player.  Sports have always been and will always be a <span class="standout">huge</span> part of my life.<br>   I also like to write about life philosophy.  I keep this light as I don't have a lot of background.  But, I do think that <br>everyone needs a life philosophy to guide them through some of life's rockier patches.  As for myself, I'm a huge fan of <em>Stoicism</em>.</p>

        <h3>Here is a centered heading.</h3>
        <p class="justified">Here is a paragraph that is 'justified.'  This isn't like Raylon Givens 'justified,' but it still sounds very cool.  Hopefully it works, because I'm not 100% sure that I fully understand the use of paragraph justification.  We shall see, I suppose.</p>

        <p class="allmargin">Here is my paragraph in all margins.  I would like to keep this fairly simple.  However, I have to write enough so that it takes up a large enough amount of space that it is possible to demonstrate a paragraph.  Is this enough?</p>
